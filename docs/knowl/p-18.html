<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A common frustration when learning mathematics is the inclusion of variables (written as letters) and what their role is in learning mathematics. The important idea here is that there are some quantities that we cannot know or that may change. We would still like to be able to explore these ideas and model real-world phenomenon where not everything we are interested in is constant. For instance, consider the scenerio where a student is planning their time to read a mathematics textbook (perhaps an online review text). The student knows that the time it takes to read each section is fairly constant at \(20\) minutes per section. Each week, the student needs to read a different number of sections. In this example, the time to read a section is the constant (\(20\) minutes), while the number of sections to read is a variable as it changes each week. By representing the number of sections as a variable, it is easy to calculate the time required to read any number of sections by changing the value of this variable. If we wanted to see the possible values in a certain range (say 2 sections per week to 20 sections per week), we could put these values in a table or a graph, which we will discuss in a later chapter.</p>
