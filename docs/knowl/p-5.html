<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Begin by reading the text, stopping peridoically to try to explain the ideas in your own words without looking. This form of "active recall" is important for retaining these ideas. When you arrive at an example problem, try to work it out yourself prior to showing the solution. If you are correct, confirm that your process aligns with the explanation provided. If you are incorrect, see if you can work out where the mistake occurred and what may have caused to you to make this error. You have likely heard it said that mistakes are how we learn, and it is important that we actively seek to learn from these mistakes through examining our work. Exercises provide slightly less structure for solutions compared to the examples.</p>
