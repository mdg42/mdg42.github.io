<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This resource is intended to support SNHU students who wish to review material that they may need prior to taking their first mathematics course. This material is not a replacement for a textbook, but serves as a guide for reviewing key ideas. You may find it helpful to also consult material such as OpenStax for additional guidance. Beyond the text itself, this resource includes several options for you to interact with and explore mathematics to gain a strong conceptual understanding. Therefore, you will see that there are more exercises and opportunities for interaction than text. For more guidance, please see the section below on how to use this book.</p>
