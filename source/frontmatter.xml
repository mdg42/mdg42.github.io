        <p>This resource is intended to support SNHU students who wish to review material that they may need
        prior to taking their first mathematics course. This material is not a replacement for a textbook, but serves
        as a guide for reviewing key ideas. You may find it helpful to also consult material such as OpenStax for additional
        guidance. Beyond the text itself, this resource includes several options for you to interact with and explore mathematics 
        to gain a strong conceptual understanding. Therefore, you will see that there are more exercises and opportunities for
        interaction than text. For more guidance, please see the section below on how to use this book.</p>

        <p>How to Use This Book:</p>
        <p>Begin by reading the text, stopping peridoically to try to explain the ideas in your own words without looking.
        This form of "active recall" is important for retaining these ideas. When you arrive at an example problem, try to 
        work it out yourself prior to showing the solution. If you are correct, confirm that your process aligns with the 
        explanation provided. If you are incorrect, see if you can work out where the mistake occurred and what may have 
        caused to you to make this error. You have likely heard it said that mistakes are how we learn, and it is important
        that we actively seek to learn from these mistakes through examining our work. Exercises provide slightly less structure
        for solutions compared to the examples. </p>
